# Implication Table Method for State Reduction

## Overview

The **Implication Table Method** is a systematic approach for reducing finite state machines by identifying and merging equivalent states. This implementation provides a complete solution for state table reduction in both complete and incomplete specified networks.

## Features

✅ **Complete and Incomplete Networks**: Supports both complete specified networks (all transitions defined) and incomplete specified networks (some transitions undefined)

✅ **Comprehensive State Analysis**: Generates detailed implication tables to identify equivalent states

✅ **Automatic State Reduction**: Merges equivalent states and produces optimized state tables

✅ **Multiple Output Formats**: Displays original state table, implication table, equivalent classes, and reduced state table

✅ **Robust Error Handling**: Validates input data and handles edge cases

✅ **Well-Documented Code**: Extensively commented for readability and future modifications

## Algorithm Overview

The Implication Table Method works in several phases:

1. **Initial Setup**: Create an implication table comparing all state pairs
2. **Direct Comparison**: Mark states as different (X) if their outputs differ for any input
3. **Indirect Comparison**: Mark states as different if their next states are already marked as different
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Repeat until no more changes occur
5. **Equivalent Class Formation**: Group states that are not marked as different
6. **State Table Reduction**: Replace equivalent states with representative states

## Input Format

### Network Type
- **0**: Complete Specified Networks (all state transitions defined)
- **1**: Incomplete Specified Networks (some transitions may be undefined)

### State Table Format
The state table is provided as a 2D character array where:
- Each row represents a state
- Each column pair represents (next_state, output) for each input
- **'-'** represents unknown/undefined states in incomplete networks

### Example Input Structure
```
Network Type: 0 (complete) or 1 (incomplete)
Number of States: 4
Number of Inputs: 2
State Table Elements:
State A: B/0 C/1
State B: A/1 D/0
State C: D/0 A/1
State D: C/1 B/0
```

## Output Format

### 1. State Table Before Reduction
Displays the original state table with all states and their transitions.

### 2. Implication Table
Shows the comparison matrix between all state pairs:
- **T**: States are equivalent
- **X**: States are different
- **Empty**: Relationship to be determined

### 3. Equivalent Classes
Lists groups of states that are equivalent and can be merged:
```
Equivalent Classes:
Class 1: {A, C}
Class 2: {B, D}
```

### 4. State Table After Reduction
Displays the optimized state table with equivalent states merged.

## Key Assumptions

1. **Equivalent States**: Marked with 'T' in the implication table
2. **Different States**: Marked with 'X' in the implication table
3. **State Table Format**: 2D char array (char[][])
4. **Moore Machine Output**: Output values are repeated for each input when applicable
5. **Representative State**: First state in equivalent class is used as replacement
6. **Unknown States**: Represented by '-' character in incomplete networks

## Usage Guidelines

### For Complete Networks (Type 0)
- All state transitions must be defined
- No '-' characters should be used
- Every state must have defined next states and outputs for all inputs

### For Incomplete Networks (Type 1)
- Some transitions may be undefined
- Use '-' to represent unknown states
- Algorithm handles partial state definitions

### Input Validation
- Network type must be 0 or 1
- Number of states and inputs must be positive integers
- State table dimensions must match declared parameters

## Algorithm Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n³ × m) where n is number of states and m is number of inputs
- **Space Complexity**: O(n²) for the implication table

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid network types
- Incorrect state table dimensions
- Malformed input data
- Boundary condition violations

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Representation
- States are labeled alphabetically (A, B, C, ...)
- Inputs are labeled numerically (0, 1, 2, ...)
- Internal representation uses integer indices for efficiency

### Implication Table Construction
1. Initialize n×n boolean matrix for n states
2. Compare outputs for each input combination
3. Mark directly different states
4. Propagate differences through state transitions
5. Iterate until convergence

### Equivalent Class Formation
1. Identify unmarked state pairs (equivalent states)
2. Use Union-Find or similar algorithm to group equivalent states
3. Select representative state for each equivalence class

### State Table Reduction
1. Replace all equivalent states with their representatives
2. Remove redundant rows from state table
3. Update state transitions to use new state labels

## Example Execution

```
=== IMPLICATION TABLE METHOD FOR STATE REDUCTION ===

INPUT:
Network Type: 0
States: 4, Inputs: 2
State Table: [A,B,C,D] × [0,1]

OUTPUT:
1. Original State Table: 4×2 table
2. Implication Table: 4×4 comparison matrix
3. Equivalent Classes: 2 classes identified
4. Reduced State Table: 2×2 optimized table
```

## Applications

- **Digital Circuit Design**: Minimizing state machines in sequential circuits
